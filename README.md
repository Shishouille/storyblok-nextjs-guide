## Demo

[Demo is available here](storyblok-nextjs-guide.vercel.app/)

## Requirements

See the `env.local` file ? Rename it to `.env.local` and add your environments variables.
Access token is only available on Storyblok. If it's not already the case, create an account and add your access token, available on settings.
Your secret key must be a secret you only share with Storyblok and your app. Don't share it with anyone else.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
